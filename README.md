DESCRIPTION
This project uses a coast-wide data set of observations to build random forest models of bottom substrate using predictors at two resolutions (20 and 100 m) for all Pacific Canadian waters and 5 subretions. The predictive performance of the models is then tested using independent data sets.

R version 3.6.2 x64

UPDATES

February 2020
Intial repo commit includes a control file (IDE_main.R) and a constants and functions file (Sediment_Functions.R). The control file runs to completion. It imports and structures data, creating models, and tabulates some intial independent data evaluation results. 
NOTE: Data load and model build can be time consuming. Separate local folders (/DATA, /MODELS, /RESULTS) are used to store the most recent versions of these.
